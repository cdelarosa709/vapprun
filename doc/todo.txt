TODO:
2. Update README with new command syntax
3. Wite a User Guide
4. Complete labs frontpage

NICE TO HAVE:
1. Property validation
3. Deploy/export commands that integrates with OVF Tool
5. Create shorthands for commands, e.g. 'ic' and 'ac' for the above
6. Refactor logging/output print statements to use a common library
8. Switch from XML to YAML config files? (they do look nicer)
9. OVF XML extensibility module
    . Store unparsed XML as files
    . Plug-in interface to consume them
11. Create a better network model, where an IP pool maps to named networks, and named networks maps to vmics. Currently, vapprun really only support a single NIC.
15. Add description to properties

FIXED:
4. Rename commands 'deploy'->'instance-config' and 'config'->'app-config'
7. Support 'transport' setting, so it can be controlled whether iso or guestEnv transport should be used
10. Add a version number to vapprun.cfg, so OVF Tool can validate the version
14. Unmount ovfenv ISO on shutdown
12. default values for properties are not handled correctly (e.g., a property with value="small", still get overriden as "CHANGE-ME)
13. Should support userConfigurable flag for properties
